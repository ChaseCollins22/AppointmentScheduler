To run the program, create a run-configuration with the above versions of the JDK and JavaFX SDK. Once configured, run the program.
You will be met with a login screen like any other. Log in with username: test and password: test. From here you will be shown the
main appointment screen. You can filter appointments by the current week or month. You can add appointments via the add appointment button.
To modify an appointment, first click on an appointment in the table and then click modify. To delete an appointment, first click on an
appointment in the table and then click delete. The logout button will bring you back to the login screen.

You can view customers by clicking the radio button 'View Customers'. This will take you to the customer screen where you will be able to
view all the customers and their information. Like an appointment, you are able to add, modify, and delete customers in the same way.
On the bottom of either the appointment screen or customer screen, you will see a 'Generate Reports' button. This will take you to
a screen where customers can be filtered by their type, postal code, and by month created. A contact schedule will also be available.
The contact schedule shows all appointments for each contact available.
